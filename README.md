`chevron` is a collection of function to create standard tables, listings, and graphs for clinical trials reporting.

## Installation

It is recommended that you [create and use a GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to install the latest version of this package. Once you have the PAT, run the following:

```r
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_access_token_here")
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/chevron@*release")
```

## Usage

```r
library(chevron)

data(syn_data)
run(aet02, syn_data)
```

which returns
