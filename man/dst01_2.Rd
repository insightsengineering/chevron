\arguments{
\item{adam_db}{(\code{dm}) object containing the ADaM datasets}

\item{armvar}{(\code{character}) variable used for column splitting}

\item{status_var}{(\code{character}) variable used to define patient status. Default is \code{EOSSTT}, however can also be a
variable name with the pattern \code{EOPxxSTT} where \code{xx} must be substituted by 2 digits referring to the analysis
period.}

\item{disc_reason_var}{(\code{string}) variable used to define reason for patient withdrawal. Default is \code{DCSREAS},
however can also be a variable with the pattern \code{DCPxxRS} where \code{xx} must be substituted by 2 digits referring to
the analysis period.}

\item{lbl_overall}{(\code{character}) label used for overall column, if set to \code{NULL} the overall column is omitted}

\item{prune_0}{(\code{logical}) remove 0 count rows}

\item{deco}{(\code{character}) decoration with \code{title}, \code{subtitles} and \code{main_footer} content}

\item{.study}{(\code{list})  with default values for the arguments of the function}

\item{status}{(\code{string}) variable used to define patient status. Default is \code{EOSSTT}, however can also be a variable
name with the pattern \code{EOPxxSTT} where \code{xx} must be substituted by 2 digits referring to the analysis period.}

\item{completed_lbl}{(\code{string}) associated with completed study and found in the columns given by \code{status}. By
Default \code{COMPLETED}.}

\item{ongoing_lbl}{(\code{string}) associated with ongoing treatment and found in the columns given by \code{status_treatment}.
By Default `ONGOING.}

\item{discontinued_lbl}{(\code{string}) associated with discontinued study and found in the columns given by \code{status}. By
Default \code{DISCONTINUED}.}
}
\description{
The DST01_2 Disposition Table provides an overview of patients study completion. For patients who discontinued the
study, the reason provided is categorized as "Safety" or "Non-Safety" issue.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Non-standard disposition table summarizing the reasons for patient withdrawal.
\item Withdrawal reasons are grouped into Safety and Non-Safety issues.
\item Safety issues include Death and Adverse events.
\item Numbers represent absolute numbers of patients and fraction of \code{N}.
\item Remove zero-count rows.
\item Split columns by arm.
\item Include a total column by default.
\item Sort withdrawal reasons by alphabetic order.
}

Since the two parts of the tables are pruned differently, the layout function returns a list of layouts,
which allows the tables to be constructed and pruned separately before binding.
