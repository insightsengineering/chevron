## Introduction 
The `chevron` package is a collection of function to create standard tables, listings, and graphs for clinical trials
reporting. Here we present the logic to request new tables for the end users and how to construct new table functions
for the programmers. The list of the already available functions is available
[here](https://glowing-giggle-c0c5190c.pages.github.io/reference/index.html). The naming convention for table functions
is `<table name>_<version>`. ex: `aet02_2`. The default version is by convention the number 1. Layouts are internal
functions that determine the underlying structure of a table. One table function is generally associated with one layout
function. The naming convention for layout is  `<table name>_<version>_lyt`. ex: `aet02_2_lyt`.

### How to request a table
In order to request a function that will generate a new table, please create an issue in the "TLG (ordered priority)" of
the [chevron backlog](https://github.com/orgs/insightsengineering/projects/34). Private repositories on github do not
support yaml issue templates but you can use the format below to accurately describe your requirements. Adding images of
the required table (without confidential information) is also very useful. Several versions of the same table can be
(should be) requested in a same issue.



># ex: AET02
>
>## Table Name
>Standard name of the table. [see TLG catalog]  
>_ex. AET02_
>
>## URL
>Link to an external file describing the table  
>
>## Description
>Details on the generic purpose of the table  
>_ex. This is an adverse event table_
>
>## Analysis dataset
>Name of the standard dataset input  
>_ex. ADAE_
>
>## Analysis filtering
>Filtering criteria of the input  
>_ex. ANL01FL = "Y"_
>
>## Analysis population
>The selected population, typically SE, AP or IT  
>_ex. SE_
>
>## Column Variable
>Names of the columns splitting variables in hierarchical order  
>_ex. ACTARM_
>
>## Analysis variables
>Names of the rows splitting variables in hierarchical order  
>_ex. AEBODSYS, AEDECOD, ASEV_  
>_ex._  
>    _1. AEBODSYS_  
>    _2. AEDECOD_  
>    _3. ASEV_  
>
>## Analysis concept
>Alternative table description for summary tables similar to AET01  
>_ex._  
>- _Serious AE_  
>- _Related AE_  
>- _Total number of AEs_  
>
>## Statistics
>Description of the statistical procedure  
>_ex. Frequency count and % (based on N)_
>
>## Default treatment of zero count rows
>Choose one option:  
>- "Remove zero count rows by default"  
>- "Keep zero count rows by default"  
>- "Always ask for user input"  
>- "Not applicable / Other"  
>
>## Comments
>_ex. Some additional details_



### How to create a new table function for developpers
The current practice is to use the body of the table-creating function to isolate the labels and variable names that are
used as title, subtitles, parameters names etc in the table layout. The function then calls the corresponding layout
function to create the structure of the table. It then builds the table by combining the clinical data and the layout.
Finally, it modifies the table based on the aggregated results, for instance removing the rows with no counts, and
returns the table.

Data processing and standardization should be performed before feeding the data to `chevron`. Table function

The [TLG catalog](https://docs.nest.roche.com/releases/2021_07_07/user-guide/) provides examples on how to construct
table layouts.
